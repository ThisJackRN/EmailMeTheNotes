# Email Me The Notes
##  What is this?

- Email Me The Notes is a site I made to help lazy students like me and get a bunch of notes without having to go out and ask! or another place to upload and share notes as needed.

## NOTE: THIS IS BARELY A BETA

 - I got most of what I need working (AND STABLE) but over time if this gets more popular I definitely would need to change a lot (Handling better of users/file storage). So consider this a run to see if anyone would fund this if not enjoy this open source project! 

 
## How can I help?
 - Feel free to modify and edit the code with updates and things to help my code that is pretty much a Stackoverflow nightmare! If you also can't code or such feel free to make an issue request!

## How can I support you?

If for some reason in the future, you want to support me I'll make probably one of those buymeacoffee account (i don't even like coffee) most of the money would go towards server cost and such. but for now no need I got a year of this for free so gotta cook yknow...
